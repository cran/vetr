## Trust, but Verify

### Easily

When you write functions that operate on  S3 or unclassed objects you can either
trust that your inputs will be structured as expected, or tediously check that
they are.

`vetr` takes the tedium out of structure verification, so that you can trust,
but verify.  It lets you express structural requirements declaratively with
templates, and it auto-generates human-friendly error messages as needed.

### Quickly

`vetr` is written in C to minimize overhead from parameter checks in your
functions.  It has no dependencies.
