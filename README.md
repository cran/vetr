[![Project Status: WIP - Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](http://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](http://www.repostatus.org/#wip)


## Trust, but Verify

### Easily

When you write functions that operate on  S3 or unclassed objects you can either
trust that your inputs will be structured as expected, or tediously check that
they are.

`vetr` takes the tedium out of structure verification so that you can trust,
but verify.  It lets you express structural requirements declaratively with
templates, and it auto-generates human-friendly error messages as needed.

### Quickly

`vetr` is written in C to minimize overhead from parameter checks in your
functions.  It has no dependencies.



## Declarative Checks with Templates

### Templates

Declare a template that an object should conform to, and let `vetr` take care of
the rest:


```r
library(vetr)
tpl <- numeric(1L)
vet(tpl, 1:3)
## [1] "`length(1:3)` should be 1 (is 3)"
vet(tpl, "hello")
## [1] "`\"hello\"` should be type \"numeric\" (is \"character\")"
vet(tpl, 42)
## [1] TRUE
```

Zero length templates match any length:


```r
tpl <- integer()
vet(tpl, 1L:3L)
## [1] TRUE
vet(tpl, 1L)
## [1] TRUE
```

And for convenience short (<= 100 length) integer-like numerics are considered
integer:


```r
tpl <- integer(1L)
vet(tpl, 1)       # this is a numeric, not an integer
## [1] TRUE
vet(tpl, 1.0001)
## [1] "`1.0001` should be type \"integer-like\" (is \"double\")"
```

`vetr` can compare recursive objects such as lists, or data.frames:


```r
tpl.iris <- iris[0, ]      # 0 row DF matches any number of rows in object
iris.fake <- iris
levels(iris.fake$Species)[3] <- "sibirica"   # tweak levels

vet(tpl.iris, iris)
## [1] TRUE
vet(tpl.iris, iris.fake)
## [1] "`levels(iris.fake$Species)[3]` should be \"virginica\" (is \"sibirica\")"
```

From our declared template `iris[0, ]`, `vetr` infers all the required checks.
In this case, `vet(iris[0, ], iris.fake, stop=TRUE)` is equivalent to:


```r
stopifnot_iris <- function(x) {
  stopifnot(
    is.data.frame(x),
    is.list(x),
    length(x) == length(iris),
    identical(lapply(x, class), lapply(iris, class)),
    is.integer(attr(x, 'row.names')),
    identical(names(x), names(iris)),
    identical(typeof(x$Species), "integer"),
    identical(levels(x$Species), levels(iris$Species))
  )
}
stopifnot_iris(iris.fake)
## Error: identical(levels(x$Species), levels(iris$Species)) is not TRUE
```

`vetr` saved us typing, and the time and thought needed to come up with what
needs to be compared.

You could just as easily have created templates for nested lists, or data frames
in lists.  Templates are compared to objects with the `alike` function.  For a
thorough description of templates and how they work see the [`alike`
vignette][2].  For template examples see `example(alike)`.

### Auto-Generated Error Messages

Let's revisit the error message:


```r
vet(tpl.iris, iris.fake)
## [1] "`levels(iris.fake$Species)[3]` should be \"virginica\" (is \"sibirica\")"
```

It tells us:

* The reason for the failure
* What structure would be acceptable instead
* The location of failure `levels(iris.fake$Species)[3]`

`vetr` does what it can to reduce the time from error to resolution.  The
location of failure is generated such that you can easily copy it in part or
full to the R prompt for further examination.

## Vetting Expressions


You can combine templates with `&&` / `||`:


```r
vet(numeric(1L) || NULL, NULL)
## [1] TRUE
vet(numeric(1L) || NULL, 42)
## [1] TRUE
vet(numeric(1L) || NULL, "foo")
## [1] "`\"foo\"` should be `NULL`, or type \"numeric\" (is \"character\")"
```

Templates only check structure.  When you need to check values use `.` to
refer to the object:


```r
vet(numeric(1L) && . > 0, -42)  # strictly positive scalar numeric
## [1] "`-42 > 0` is not TRUE (FALSE)"
vet(numeric(1L) && . > 0, 42)
## [1] TRUE
```

You can compose vetting expressions as language objects and combine them:


```r
scalar.num.pos <- quote(numeric(1L) && . > 0)
foo.or.bar <- quote(character(1L) && . %in% c('foo', 'bar'))
vet.exp <- quote(scalar.num.pos || foo.or.bar)

vet(vet.exp, 42)
## [1] TRUE
vet(vet.exp, "foo")
## [1] TRUE
vet(vet.exp, "baz")
## [1] "At least one of these should pass:"                         
## [2] "  - `\"baz\" %in% c(\"foo\", \"bar\")` is not TRUE (FALSE)" 
## [3] "  - `\"baz\"` should be type \"numeric\" (is \"character\")"
```

`all_bw` is available for value range checks (~10x faster than
`isTRUE(all(. >= x & . <= y))` for large vectors):


```r
vet(all_bw(., 0, 1), runif(5) + 1)
## [1] "`all_bw(runif(5) + 1, 0, 1)` is not TRUE (is chr: \"`1.114960` at index 1 not in `[0,1]`\")"
```

There are a number of predefined vetting tokens you can use in your
vetting expressions such as:


```r
vet(NUM.POS, -runif(5))    # positive numeric; see `?vet_token` for others
## [1] "`-runif(5)` should contain only positive values, but has negatives"
```

Vetting expressions are designed to be intuitive to use, but their
implementation is complex.  We recommend you look at `example(vet)` for usage
ideas, or at the ["Non Standard Evaluation" section of the vignette][3] for the
gory details.


## `vetr` in Functions

If you are vetting function inputs, you can use the `vetr` function, which works
just like `vet` except that it is streamlined for use within functions:


```r
fun <- function(x, y) {
  vetr(numeric(1L), logical(1L))
  TRUE   # do work...
}
fun(1:2, "foo")
## Error in fun(x = 1:2, y = "foo"): For argument `x`, `length(1:2)` should be 1 (is 2)
fun(1, "foo")
## Error in fun(x = 1, y = "foo"): For argument `y`, `"foo"` should be type "logical" (is "character")
```

`vetr` automatically matches the vetting expressions to the corresponding
arguments and fetches the argument values from the function environment.

See [vignette][4] for additional details on how the `vetr` function works.

## Additional Documentation

* [`vetr` vignette][1], `?vet`, `?vetr`, `example(vet)`, `example(vetr)`.
* [`alike` vignette][2], `?alike`, and `example(alike)` for discussion of
  templates.
* A survey of [parameter validation functions][5].

## Development Status

`vetr` is still in development, although most of the features are considered
mature.  The most likely area of change is the treatment of function and
language templates (e.g.  `alike(sum, max)`), and more flexible treatment of
list templates (e.g. in future lists may be allowed to be different lengths so
long as every named element in the template exists in the object).

## Installation


```r
install.packages('vetr')
```

Or for the development version:


```r
# install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github('brodieg/vetr@development')
```

## Alternatives

There are many alternatives available to `vetr`.  We do a survey of the
following in our [parameter validation functions][5] review:



* `stopifnot` by R Core
* [`vetr`](https://github.com/brodieG/vetr) by Yours Truly
* [`asserthat`](https://github.com/hadley/assertthat) by Hadley Wickham
* [`assertive`](https://www.r-pkg.org/pkg/assertive) by Richie Cotton
* [`checkmate`](https://github.com/mllg/checkmate) by Michel Lang

The following packages also perform related tasks, although we do not review
them:

* [`valaddin`](https://github.com/egnha/valaddin) v0.1.0 by Eugene Ha, a
  framework for augmenting existing functions with validation contracts.
  Currently the package is undergoing a major overhaul so we will add it to the
  comparison once the new release (v0.3.0) is out.
* [`ensurer`](https://github.com/smbache/ensurer) v1.1 by Stefan M. Bache, a
  framework for flexibly creating and combining validation contracts.  The
  development version adds an experimental method for creating type safe
  functions, but it is not published to CRAN so we do not test it here.
* [`validate`](https://github.com/data-cleaning/validate) by Mark van
  der Loo and Edwin de Jonge, with a primary focus on validating data in data
  frames and similar data structures.
* [`assertr`](https://github.com/ropensci/assertr) by Tony Fischetti, also
  focused on data validation in data frames and similar structures.
* [`types`](https://github.com/jimhester/types) by Jim Hester, which implements
  but does not enforce type hinting.
* [`argufy`](https://github.com/gaborcsardi/argufy) by G치bor Cs치rdi, which
  implements parameter validation via roxygen tags (not released to CRAN).
